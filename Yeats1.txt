Under Ben Bulben 
By William Butler Yeats 
I

Swear by what the Sages spoke   
Round the Mareotic Lake
That the Witch of Atlas knew,   
Spoke and set the cocks a-crow.

Swear by those horsemen, by those women,   
Complexion and form prove superhuman,   
That pale, long visaged company
That airs an immortality
Completeness of their passions won;   
Now they ride the wintry dawn
Where Ben Bulben sets the scene.

Here's the gist of what they mean.
